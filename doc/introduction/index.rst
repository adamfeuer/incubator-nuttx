Introduction
============

`Apache NuttX <https://nuttx.incubator.apache.org/>`_ is a very capable, configurable, fast,
`POSIX <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX>`_-compatible, internet-connected
`real-time operating system <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_operating_system>`_.

These pages are meant to be an experiment in replacing the `Apache NuttX Documentation <https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/NUTTX/Nuttx>`_
with something easier to navigate, extend, and modify.

.. warning:: This is a work in progress, many links don't work and a lot of formatting is broken.
